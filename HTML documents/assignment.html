	         <h1> The Life of Cats </h1>
			 <h3> Historic origins </h3>
			 
			 <p> The earlier ancestors of today's domestic cats spread from southwest Asia and into Europe 
			 as early as 4400 B.C. The cats likely started hanging around farming communities in the Fertile Crescent 
		    about 8,000 years ago, where they settled into a mutually beneficial relationship as humans' rodent patrol.</p>
			
			<p> Here is a quotation from Wikipedia about cats: </p> 
			<blockquote cite =" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"> The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small 
			carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to 
			distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
