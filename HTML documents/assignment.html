	         <h1> The Life of Cats </h1>
			 <h3> Historic origins </h3>
			 <p> The earlier ancestors of today's domestic cats spread from southwest Asia and into Europe 
			 as early as 4400 B.C. The cats likely started hanging around farming communities in the Fertile Crescent 
		    about 8,000 years ago, where they settled into a mutually beneficial relationship as humans' rodent patrol.</p>
